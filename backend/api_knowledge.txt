# API Basics
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

# Types of APIs
- REST API: Uses HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Data is usually in JSON format.
- SOAP API: Uses XML messages for exchanging data, more rigid structure.
- GraphQL API: Clients request only the data they need in a single query.

# Authentication Methods
- API Key: Unique key to access an API.
- OAuth 2.0: Token-based authentication protocol for secure access.
- Basic Auth: Username and password sent with each request.

# HTTP Status Codes
- 200: OK (request succeeded)
- 201: Created (new resource created)
- 400: Bad Request (invalid request)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- 403: Forbidden (access denied)
- 404: Not Found (endpoint does not exist)
- 500: Internal Server Error (server failed)

# API Endpoints Examples
- GET /users: Retrieve a list of users
- POST /users: Create a new user
- PUT /users/{id}: Update user information
- DELETE /users/{id}: Remove a user

# Best Practices
- Version your API (e.g., v1, v2)
- Use proper HTTP status codes for errors and successes
- Provide clear error messages
- Limit request rate to prevent abuse (rate limiting)
- Secure sensitive data (HTTPS, authentication)
